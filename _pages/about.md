I am researcher working on developing emerging transportation technologies. My goal is to steer the development and deployment of transportation technologies to serve the need for safe, sustainable, multicephalous, and accessible mobility. 

Originally I am from the mountainous village "Aabey" in Lebanon. I grew up strolling narrow streets, flaneuring mountain woods, and preserving Mediterranean architecture.
