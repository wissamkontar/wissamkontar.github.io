1. ## The Promise of Sustainable Transportation: An Environmental Investigation of Emerging Transportation Technology
Presented at the Soceity of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry SETAC, April 2022.

<summary><b>[Abstract]</b></summary>
It is estimated that 28% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the United States come from the transportation system, with various other toxic pollutants released from carbon-intensive modes of transportation. The urgent need to reduce harmful emissions from the transportation sector has set in motion an insuppressible momentum for adopting alternative modes of transportation such as autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and electric bicycles. Yet the adoption of these emerging modes could be overshadowing potential environmental impacts that thwarts efforts of creating a sustainable transportation system. It is an environmental imperative to reduce the environmental impacts of transportation, to slow climate change. 

In this work, we aim to reveal and quantify the hidden environmental implications of different emerging modes of transportation specifically autonomous vehicles, electric autonomous vehicles, and electric bicycles.  In a series of empirical surveys performed in Madison, Wisconsin we collect data on travelers' transportation modal choices. Data collected was used to build mathematical relationships between users' preferences of different transportation modes and the cascading environmental implications. Life cycle assessment (LCA) based on well to wheel model is adopted to further quantify environmental impacts across five different categories: energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, particulate matter, sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Further, we analyze the dependency between the energy infrastructure, mainly the electricity generation scheme, and its impact in offsetting foreseen environmental benefits from electric modes of transportation.  

Our analysis shows that autonomous vehicles and electric bicycles enjoy a great deal of attractiveness by travelers in Madison, which translates directly into use phase environmental impacts. Adopting autonomous vehicles will eventually increase emissions, however electric autonomous vehicles can offset these outcomes. On the contrary, electric bicycle sharing programs (e.g., BCycle in Madison) can alleviate the demand on carbon-intensive modes and reduce transportation emissions. Further, the way we generate electricity, and the dependency on unsustainable energy sources, can hinder our ability to decrease transportation emissions when adopting electric options. 

This work serves as a step forward in analyzing the environmental impacts of our transportation system. Ultimately, we aim to steer the development and deployment of new modes of transportation in ways that match users' adoption needs and are environmentally beneficial.
