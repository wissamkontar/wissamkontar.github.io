<summary><b>[Summary]</b></summary>
It is estimated that 28% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the United States come from the transportation system, with various other toxic pollutants released from carbon-intensive modes of transportation. The urgent need to reduce harmful emissions from the transportation sector has set in motion an insuppressible momentum for adopting alternative modes of transportation such as autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and electric bicycles. Yet the adoption of these emerging modes could be overshadowing potential environmental impacts that thwarts efforts of creating a sustainable transportation system. It is an environmental imperative to reduce the environmental impacts of transportation, to slow climate change. 

In this work, we aim to reveal and quantify the hidden environmental implications of different emerging modes of transportation specifically autonomous vehicles, electric autonomous vehicles, and electric bicycles.  In a series of empirical surveys performed in Madison, Wisconsin we collect data on travelers' transportation modal choices. Data collected was used to build mathematical relationships between users' preferences of different transportation modes and the cascading environmental implications. Life cycle assessment (LCA) based on well to wheel model is adopted to further quantify environmental impacts across five different categories: energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, particulate matter, sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Further, we analyze the dependency between the energy infrastructure, mainly the electricity generation scheme, and its impact in offsetting foreseen environmental benefits from electric modes of transportation.  

Our analysis shows that autonomous vehicles and electric bicycles enjoy a great deal of attractiveness by travelers in Madison, which translates directly into use phase environmental impacts. Adopting autonomous vehicles will eventually increase emissions, however electric autonomous vehicles can offset these outcomes. On the contrary, electric bicycle sharing programs (e.g., BCycle in Madison) can alleviate the demand on carbon-intensive modes and reduce transportation emissions. Further, the way we generate electricity, and the dependency on unsustainable energy sources, can hinder our ability to decrease transportation emissions when adopting electric options. 

This work serves as a step forward in analyzing the environmental impacts of our transportation system. Ultimately, we aim to steer the development and deployment of new modes of transportation in ways that match users' adoption needs and are environmentally beneficial.

## On Multi-class Automated Vehicles

Presented for the Traffic Flow Committee, May 2021

<summary><b>[Summary]</b></summary>
This talk will present an analysis of the car-following (CF) behavior of automated vehicles (AVs) under different vehicle control paradigms and control settings, and investigates how multi-class AVs collectively impact traffic dynamics. Two well-known controllers -- linear state-feedback control and Model Predictive Control -- are analyzed in this study. The asymmetric behavior (AB) car-following (CF) model framework is adopted, substantiated by an empirical analysis of real AV data, to analyze the different controllers in a unifying fashion. The analysis unveils the physical mechanisms of control, their manifestation in the AV CF behavior, and any discernible differences between the controllers. A wide range of control parameters are mapped into the AB model parameters through numerical simulations to understand the range of CF behavior possible. The mapped relationship is modeled by coupling logistic classifier and a convoluted Gaussian Process (GP) model to predict the CF behavior, which is validated by simulated and real AV data. These analysis results and insights are integrated to elucidate traffic-level behavior.
